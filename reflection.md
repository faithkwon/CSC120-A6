What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
    It breaks down the process of testing into much more concrete chunks -- as opposed to testing in a main method and trying to follow the output to see if it's correct, Unit Testing is a more clearcut way of making sure the code works. 

    My tests all follow the specific instructions on the README.

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Once I got used to the syntax and structure (assertTrue, assertEquals, etc.), building the tests became pretty intuitive. However, I got stuck on the last test because I didn't know how to test with a void method like printManifest() since there's no return value to compare to an expected value. I tried going to office hours and looking for a solution online, but I couldn't find a solution that both worked and I understood.
